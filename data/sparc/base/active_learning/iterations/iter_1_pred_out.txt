The inflammatory signals reach the different $STRUCTURE$ regions mainly through two disparate ways: the humoral and neural pathways, which involve a compromised blood–brain barrier (BBB) and activation of afferent fibers of the $STRUCTURE$, respectively [7].	0.9999613	3.8711096e-05
For example, visceral inflammation can be detected by the $STRUCTURE$ via terminal cytokine receptors, which further stimulates $STRUCTURE$ cholinergic nuclei and acts as negative feedback for the inflammatory response by releasing acetylcholine (Ach) at the terminal efferent nerve [16].	0.9999703	2.9712672e-05

Reflexly elicited sympathetic impulses, originating from the upper thoracic paravertebral sympathetic trunk, reach their targets via $STRUCTURE$ fibers following the arteries of the glands; the relay between pre- and postganglionic sympathetic fibers is the $STRUCTURE$.	0.9999567	4.328062e-05
This increases the risk of neurological complications after impaction surgeries; i.e. $STRUCTURE$ injury and subsequent continuous numbness in the $STRUCTURE$.	0.99995947	4.0513885e-05
This referred pain could be provoked by compression of the $STRUCTURE$ by the $STRUCTURE$ (or any other organ or structure along the nerve), causing a convergence of somatic and visceral afferent inputs to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, causing pain symptomatology in these regions (39).	0.00024238463	0.9997576
Approximately 1.3 cc of the solution were deposited close to the mandibular foramen to anesthetize the $STRUCTURE$ and the remaining 0.5 cc were infiltrated while extracting the needle in order to anesthetize the $STRUCTURE$.	0.0005698012	0.99943024
Orbital apex syndrome (OAS) is a rare disorder characterized by the involvement and damage of $STRUCTURE$, including the oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV), abducens (VI) and ophthalmic branch of the $STRUCTURE$ (V) in association with optic dys-function (1-3).	0.00020545184	0.9997946
The sensory defects are located mainly in the territories innervated by the $STRUCTURE$ and the $STRUCTURE$ (2) Most of these lesions are reversible, though more persistent cases can adversely affect patient quality of life (3).	0.9999666	3.3352775e-05
The most frequently affected territory corresponded to the third trigeminal branch: the $STRUCTURE$ in 37 cases, and the $STRUCTURE$ in 19 cases.	0.9989947	0.0010052468
The territory of the $STRUCTURE$ was affected in over two-thirds of all cases, and the territory of the $STRUCTURE$ in almost one-third.	0.9999602	3.9845083e-05
Schultze-Mosgau and Reich (11), in a series of 1107 molar extractions, reported neuropathy affecting the $STRUCTURE$ and $STRUCTURE$ in 2.2% and 1.4% of the cases, respectively.	0.9999503	4.9755417e-05
Recent studies describe how painful afference of the 2nd and 3rd branch of the $STRUCTURE$ activates the pain protection systems such that regions of the $STRUCTURE$ affected cannot identify whether the input comes from the upper maxillary bone or mandible (17,18).	0.99973166	0.00026831945
Surgery was in all cases performed under local nerve-block anesthesia of the inferior dental nerve, $STRUCTURE$, and $STRUCTURE$ with 2 x 1.8-ml capsules of 4% articaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine (Articaine; Inibsa, Barcelona, Spain).	0.9999593	4.0661507e-05
No injury of the $STRUCTURE$ and no excessive hemorrhage were recorded in either of the groups while a temporary $STRUCTURE$ paresthesia was reported by 17 patients (3.6%) in the first group and none of the patients of the second group.	0.9999049	9.510235e-05
Lower third molar extraction surgery In all cases, surgery was performed by the same surgeon, following the same procedure under local anesthesia blocking the $STRUCTURE$, $STRUCTURE$, and afterwards the buccal nerve.	0.00038635204	0.9996136
Lower third molar extraction surgery In all cases, surgery was performed by the same surgeon, following the same procedure under local anesthesia blocking the $STRUCTURE$, lingual nerve, and afterwards the $STRUCTURE$.	0.001428932	0.99857104
Lower third molar extraction surgery In all cases, surgery was performed by the same surgeon, following the same procedure under local anesthesia blocking the inferior alveolar nerve, $STRUCTURE$, and afterwards the $STRUCTURE$.	0.99981457	0.00018542886
The dura is an interface between the $STRUCTURE$ and the immune system in that peptides released from efferent endings of the $STRUCTURE$ stimulate mast cells to release mediators, including substance P and histamine, which in turn activate afferent pain fibers [32, 74].	0.9997611	0.00023888606
