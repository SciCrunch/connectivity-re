For example, visceral inflammation can be detected by the $STRUCTURE$ via terminal cytokine receptors, which further stimulates $STRUCTURE$ cholinergic nuclei and acts as negative feedback for the inflammatory response by releasing acetylcholine (Ach) at the terminal efferent nerve [16].	0.9999635	3.6461755e-05
For example, the $STRUCTURE$ is overactive in $STRUCTURE$ injury, which accounts for the disturbed chemotaxis and decline in production of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes and macrophages [11, 71].	0.99988186	0.00011815349
For example, the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP), which is composed of $STRUCTURE$ cholinergic nuclei, efferent $STRUCTURE$, and peripheral α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAchRs), is reportedly beneficial for various diseases because of its anti-inflammatory capacity [8].	0.9999209	7.908249e-05
