Axotomy of the $STRUCTURE$ trigger increased expression of CX3CL1 among the severed motor neurons in the $STRUCTURE$ [6] and a similar response was recently observed following intraparenchymal injection of prion proteins [22].	0.99996233	3.771035e-05
The inflammatory signals reach the different $STRUCTURE$ regions mainly through two disparate ways: the humoral and neural pathways, which involve a compromised blood–brain barrier (BBB) and activation of afferent fibers of the $STRUCTURE$, respectively [7].	0.9999684	3.1612857e-05
For example, visceral inflammation can be detected by the $STRUCTURE$ via terminal cytokine receptors, which further stimulates $STRUCTURE$ cholinergic nuclei and acts as negative feedback for the inflammatory response by releasing acetylcholine (Ach) at the terminal efferent nerve [16].	0.9999869	1.31448905e-05
For example, the $STRUCTURE$ is overactive in $STRUCTURE$ injury, which accounts for the disturbed chemotaxis and decline in production of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes and macrophages [11, 71].	0.99998736	1.2610036e-05
For example, the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP), which is composed of $STRUCTURE$ cholinergic nuclei, efferent $STRUCTURE$, and peripheral α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAchRs), is reportedly beneficial for various diseases because of its anti-inflammatory capacity [8].	0.99998784	1.2143034e-05
It mainly constitutes the following three parts: $STRUCTURE$ for signal integration, processing and transition, efferent $STRUCTURE$ for signal transmission, and cellular α7nAchR for initiating intracellular machinery [8].	0.9999864	1.3633348e-05
In traumatic $STRUCTURE$ injury (TBI), for instance, the $STRUCTURE$ presents with obvious overactivity, which is responsible for the development of immune paralysis, suggesting that there is feedback for the loss of brain cholinergic nuclei [11].	0.9999854	1.4671039e-05

Peripheral inflammatory signals are captured by receptors of immune-transmitter in afferent $STRUCTURE$, such as receptors of IL-1β and prostaglandins, and then reach the $STRUCTURE$ of the central nervous system [101, 102].	0.99998945	1.0579407e-05
