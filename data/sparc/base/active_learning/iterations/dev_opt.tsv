Also, many critical structures surround the thyroid gland, such as the $STRUCTURE$, trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, carotid artery, $STRUCTURE$, and cervical sympathetic ganglion (24).	0
Consistent with the adult anatomy (Fig. 1b) as well as previous descriptions [30–32], the oculomotor nerve (III) innervated the ‘mr’, ‘sr’, ‘ir’, and ‘io’ muscles (Fig. 3b), the $STRUCTURE$ (IV) the ‘so’ muscles (Fig. 3c), and the $STRUCTURE$ (VI) the ‘lr’ muscles (Fig. 3d).	0
Hepatic afferent stimulation of the $STRUCTURE$ via the $STRUCTURE$ excites efferent vagal outflow counteracting excessive cytokine production and thus ameliorating inflammatory responses.	1
Among these tissues and fluids, the infectivity was detected in the brainstem, and thoracic and lumber spinal cords by RIII mice bioassay, and in the $STRUCTURE$, optic nerve, $STRUCTURE$, facial nerve, sciatic nerve, and semitendinosus muscle by the Tgbov XV mice bioassay.	0
Stay sutures can be placed in the pericardium just $STRUCTURE$ the $STRUCTURE$ to aid dissection and manipulation.	1
The tensor muscle was drilled using a microdiamond burr until the $STRUCTURE$ was visualized to identify the tympanic segment of the $STRUCTURE$.	0
Recent electrophysiological studies also reveal the communication between $STRUCTURE$ and facial nerves at the level of the solitary nucleus of the facial nerve in medulla and $STRUCTURE$ (58).	0
CCK is secreted from I-type enteroendocrine cells in the duodenum and small intestine to intestinal lamina propria where it binds to CCK receptors on the $STRUCTURE$ terminal, transferring satiety signals to the hypothalamus via the $STRUCTURE$ and pontine parabrachial nucleus [34].	1
Stimulation of the Dorsal Genital Nerve (DGNS), Tibial Nerve (TNS), the $STRUCTURE$ of S2-4 (SNS) and of the $STRUCTURE$ at the T12 vertebral level (SS) all have evidence suggesting efficacy at improving neurogenic Lower Urinary Tract (LUT) storage dysfunction.	0
Vagus departs the brainstem as its cranial nerve X, and vagal efferent outflow regulates visceral organs by counterbalancing sympathoexcitation, inhibiting cytokine release, and safeguarding against inflammatory damage to liver, $STRUCTURE$, $STRUCTURE$, lungs, or kidneys in endotoxaemic states.	0
CCK is secreted from I-type enteroendocrine cells in the duodenum and $STRUCTURE$ to intestinal lamina propria where it binds to CCK receptors on the vagus nerve terminal, transferring satiety signals to the hypothalamus via the $STRUCTURE$ and pontine parabrachial nucleus [34].	0
Anatomical structures that can be injured during an anterior approach to expose the cervical part of the vagus nerve are the common facial vein, IJV, superior and $STRUCTURE$, $STRUCTURE$, transverse cervical nerve, hypoglossal nerve, C1 and C2 spinal nerve roots, and ansa cervicalis.	0
The levels of α1 in the $STRUCTURE$ [BLA; (C)] and $STRUCTURE$ (BST) (D), as well as the levels of α2 at all these sites (E–H), were similar between HADs and LADs.	0
Branches of the facial (chorda tympani and $STRUCTURE$), $STRUCTURE$, and vagus (superior laryngeal) nerves, which synapse with receptor cells in the taste buds, convey taste messages to the first relay nucleus, the rostral part of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS).	0
2]The cervical plexus includes also deep branches to the neck muscles and the $STRUCTURE$ (C3, C4, and C5) in addition to communicating branches to the $STRUCTURE$, hypoglossal, and spinal accessory nerves.[	0
Labeled fibers packed into the ventrolateral subnucleus of the $STRUCTURE$ (Sol; A2, arrow) and extended toward the lateral part of the $STRUCTURE$.	0
3V, third ventricle, AP, $STRUCTURE$; ARC, arcuate nucleus; cc, central canal; LPB, lateral parabrachial nucleus; NTS, nucleus tractus solitarius; DMNX, $STRUCTURE$.	0
Only the most prominent nervous connections, such as the penis nerve cord (pnc, Fig. 8a), connecting the $STRUCTURE$ to the $STRUCTURE$ can be detected.	1
