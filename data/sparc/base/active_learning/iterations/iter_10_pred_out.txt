Axotomy of the $STRUCTURE$ trigger increased expression of CX3CL1 among the severed motor neurons in the $STRUCTURE$ [6] and a similar response was recently observed following intraparenchymal injection of prion proteins [22].	0.9999514	4.8614067e-05
The inflammatory signals reach the different $STRUCTURE$ regions mainly through two disparate ways: the humoral and neural pathways, which involve a compromised blood–brain barrier (BBB) and activation of afferent fibers of the $STRUCTURE$, respectively [7].	0.9999623	3.7786544e-05
For example, visceral inflammation can be detected by the $STRUCTURE$ via terminal cytokine receptors, which further stimulates $STRUCTURE$ cholinergic nuclei and acts as negative feedback for the inflammatory response by releasing acetylcholine (Ach) at the terminal efferent nerve [16].	0.9999754	2.4656438e-05
For example, the $STRUCTURE$ is overactive in $STRUCTURE$ injury, which accounts for the disturbed chemotaxis and decline in production of proinflammatory cytokines by monocytes and macrophages [11, 71].	0.9999656	3.442573e-05
For example, the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP), which is composed of $STRUCTURE$ cholinergic nuclei, efferent $STRUCTURE$, and peripheral α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAchRs), is reportedly beneficial for various diseases because of its anti-inflammatory capacity [8].	0.99996656	3.341508e-05
